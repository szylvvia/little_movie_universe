## About app

The developed platform is aimed at users who are connected in films, whether professionally or as a hobby. The online movie database gathers existing film productions, allowing the user to familiarize himself with works he is not familiar with, as well as to systematize his collections. Films can be in collections to watch and favorites. Taking into account the community aspect, a logged-in user will be able to add a film item, but it must be unique within the entire film base. In addition, the user will be able to add a rating and review to each movie item. Due to the visibility of ratings and reviews to everyone, the user will have the opportunity to familiarize himself with the opinions of users, often with different views and tastes, thus broadening his horizons. A ranking of movies will also play a not inconsiderable role, which will be based on user ratings, sorting movies from the highest average rating. The ability to create a unique user account tailored to their preferences will allow everyone to express themselves. The streaming service Spotify and Youtube have been used in the web application under development. The use of such a solution in the application allows users to enjoy movie music and trailers without having to search for it on other platforms.
